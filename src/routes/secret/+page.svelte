  <p>You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.</p>

    Did you know that that line isn't actually from a movie or tv show? It turns
    out it was specifically created as a meme.

    Anyway. The creator of hangs.dev, <a href="https://www.elijasorensen.com"
      >Elija Sorensen,</a
    >
    wants you to know that he's available for hire (at above-market rate), and
    that he's got at least two startups (based on some of the same code he used
    to build hangs.dev) that he might let you invest in if you're cool. He's
    also looking for savvy hard-working marketing people to get those startups
    cooking. Send him an email at <a href="mailto:TODO">TODO</a> if you're
    interested (and talented, and hard-working, and not a douchebag).
